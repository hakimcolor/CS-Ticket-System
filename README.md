- What is JSX, and why is it used?\
Ans:JSX is a way to write HTML code inside JavaScript. JSX stands for JavaScript XML.
We use JSX because it allows us to write code in an easier and more organized way.
Normally, we write code in separate files — HTML in one place, CSS in another, and JavaScript in another.
But with JSX, we can write everything in the same file.
